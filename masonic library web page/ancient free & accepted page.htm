<p>Lodges and Grand Lodges whose charters' roots derive from the United Grand
Lodge of Ancient Freemasons of England, The Grand Lodge of Ireland or the Grand
Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of Scotland use the expression, A.'.F.'.&amp;
A.'.M.'.</p>
<p>Those Grand Lodges that don't use the appellation &quot;Ancient&quot;, claim
descent from the &quot;Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons under the
constitution of England&quot;.</p>
<p>This Grand Lodge was constituted from four lodges on June 24, 1717 and
designated &quot;Modern&quot;. The &quot;Moderns&quot; and &quot;Ancients&quot;
united in November 25, 1813 to form the United Grand Lodge of Ancient Freemasons
of England.</p>
