PENALTIES</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#0000ff" face="Times New Roman"><b>Many Masons believe that the
penalties of our obligations are land-marks handed down from</b> <b>antiquity.
This is not so. The Old Charges or Manuscripts, the first being the Regius Poem
written in 1390 A.D., all contain Charges or &quot;land-marks&quot; that we use
today, but not until the Edinburgh Regiser House Manuscript of 1696 was there
any mention of a penalty.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#0000ff" face="Times New Roman"><b>Most of the books written
about Masonry between 1696 and 1750 were exposures. Of the thirteen written
before 1726, none mention a penalty; the seven written after that&nbsp; do.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#0000ff" face="Times New Roman"><b>In 1727, ten years after the
formation of the Grand Lodge of England, &quot;A Masons Confession&quot; was
published in Scotland and contained the first penalty to be found within an
obligation.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#0000ff" face="Times New Roman"><b>The Wilkinson Manuscript was
written in 1727, and included all three penalties and an early version of the
Entered Apprentice Lecture. The unique thing about that is that&nbsp; there
still may have been only degree at that time.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#0000ff" face="Times New Roman"><b>The most famous Masonic
exposure, &quot;Masonry Dissected,&quot; was written in 1730 by Samuel</b> <b>Prichard,
and in it, for the first time ever, three degrees are mentioned. A ritual is
given for each degree, but all three penalties were again listed with the
Entered Apprentice Degree.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#0000ff" face="Times New Roman"><b>Then, in &quot;Three Distinct
Knocks&quot;, published in 1760, a separate penalty was given with each degree,
each quite similar to those we use today. And, interestingly enough, when the
two main Grand Lodges of England merged in 1813, a non-physical penalty was
added to the Entered</b> <b>Apprentice obligation and went like this:</b><br>
</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000ff" face="Times New Roman"><b>&quot; . . . or that being
branded as a willfully perjured individual, void of all moral worth, and totally
unfit to be received into this or any other worthy and warranted Lodge, or the
society of men who prize honor and virtue above the external advantages of rank
and fortune . . .&quot;</b><br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000ff" face="Times New Roman"><b>It is obvious that the
penalties have never been etched in stone. They have gone from an obligation
without a penalty, to one with one penalty, to three obligations with a&nbsp;
separate penalty for each, to a non-physical penalty in 1813, and to many
changes in the wording through&nbsp; the years. Some Grand Lodges have changed
them in recent years. In 1986, the Grand Lodge of England removed them from the
obligations and put them in the lectures. The same has happened in the majority
of the Grand Lodges in Europe, two in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and
several Grand Lodges thus far in the United States. Most Grand Lodges have moved
them to the lectures; none so&nbsp; far have completely removed them. It is
known that quite a few American Grand Lodges are considering such a move.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#0000ff" face="Times New Roman"><b>The questions are these:
Should we retain a form of punishment that, Masonically, has never been
inflicted as far as anyone knows and would be against the law if we did? In the
obligation, should we simply bind a candidate symbolically to &quot;the ancient
penalty as stated in the lecture to follow?&quot; Should we continue to threaten
a candidate with bodily harm for revealing secrets that long ago ceased to be
secrets? These are questions for thought, Brethren.</b>&nbsp;</font></p>
