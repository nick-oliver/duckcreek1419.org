<br>
After the Almighty Creator had thus made man and provided for his wants,<br>
He saw that it was not good for man to be alone, so as His last and best<br>
gift to him, He created woman. She was so lovely and so winsome that<br>
what before had seemed to him most fair now seemed to him but mean; in<br>
ministry so soft and tender, in loyalty so kind and true, she has ever<br>
fulfilled her mission and helped to mend his faults and mould him into<br>
virtue.<br>
My brother, Masonry teaches many beautiful lessons, but none of<br>
more importance than true respect for womanhood. As we stand here, were<br>
I to draw for you a picture of love divine, it would not be that of a<br>
stately angel with a form that is full of grace, but a bent and toilworn<br>
woman with a grave and tender face; no golden rings would enfold her, nor<br>
rosy her cheeks nor fair, but the face of an angel of pity framed in snow<br>
white hair; her hands are not white and slender, but roughened with work<br>
and woe, by bearing other's burdens and soothing the tears that flow; no<br>
halo of light surrounds her, no wondrous power she hath, but many and<br>
many a blessing is spoken along her path; others may paint their angels<br>
with white robed forms of grace, but my sweet angel of pity has my<br>
mother's careworn face. But why endeavor to convey to you an ideal<br>
which is already enshrined within your heart, for deep down, safely<br>
locked within that secret chamber, you keep that cherished ideal, sacred<br>
and holy; it is your mother. It was she alone, all alone, who went down<br>
into the valley of the shadow of death to receive your trembling soul at<br>
the gates of life; it was she who pillowed your baby head within the<br>
elbow of her bended arm; it was from her tender breast you drew the life<br>
giving fluid that sustained you in your helpless years; it was she who<br>
first taught your lisping tongue to frame that God given prayer, &quot;Our<br>
Father, who art in heaven,&quot; in which all races, sects and kind may join.<br>
There is no man so vile, so base, so low, but who in his sin-stained<br>
soul, keeps pure and apart a little place for his mother's memory. And<br>
when, in the silent watches of the night his mind turns back to pure and<br>
happy childhood hours, he remembers that mother and is drawn closer to<br>
God.<br>
