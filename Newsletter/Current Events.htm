<P align=left><font face="Arial"> What a year! We doubled last year’s amount of 
  $1600 to a net this year of $3200!! Many thanks, to many people. We had a great 
  time as well being very productive. </font></P>
<P align=left><font face="Arial">We created an access to our parking lot via 4th 
  Street and directed vehicles through the alley way to our parking lot. Most 
  estimates are that at least 75% of the cars that we parked entered via this 
  new entrance. Hopefully, next year, we can convince the City of Garland to at 
  least build a driveway access ramp for this entrance. We may also consider at 
  least putting down some gravel to prevent any issues due to rainy weather. </font></P>
<P align=left><font face="Arial">It truly was incredible the numbers of cars that 
  came to us as a result of the city officials closing off Walnut Street in the 
  evenings. We were so busy Friday night that our parking lot was filled by 6:30 
  PM! A coordinated effort of all involved allowed us to immediately replace a 
  departing vehicle with someone waiting for a parking spot. We nearly broke the 
  $2000 mark at the end of the day. </font></P>
<P align=left><font face="Arial">Again, I cannot express enough thanks to everyone 
  who supported this very worthwhile event. The next time you see these folks, 
  be sure to thank them yourselve. It is due to their efforts that we again have 
  added funds to the Duck Creek Lodge Parking Lot Scholarship Fund.</font></P>

  to the following for their above and beyond efforts:</font></P>
<P align=left><font face="Arial"> Chuck & Joe French together with their crew 
  from <font color="#FF0033"><b>Southwest Corrosion</b></font>. For those of you 
  that don’t know, Chuck is the owner of SWC. He graciously provided his talents 
  and built the ramp that we used for our 4th Street access. His crew, led by 
  Joe French, provided the labor that moved fill dirt to finish the ramp area. 
  They also placed all of the “heavy” concrete stanchions to the different driveways 
  that we periodically blocked. </font></P>
<P align=left><font face="Arial">Erin Lucia (My lovely bride!) Thanks to Erin, 
  who provided more than one hot meal and insured that everyone stayed nourished 
  during their working hours. Also, as a result of Erin, Elisha Cook & Melissa 
  Sanders sales abilities, we sold more drinks than expected and had to make a 
  few replenishment runs for more! </font></P>
<P align=left><font face="Arial">Greg Milliron – Thanks so much for the use of 
  your companies Nextel walkie-talkies. They were truly a great asset! The communication 
  ability greatly improved our performance. We had a total of twenty eight people 
  who worked tirelessly during the 40 hours that the event took place.</font></P>
<P align=center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#0000FF"><b><font size="5">Two 
  Masters Degrees Conferred</font></b></font></P>
<P align=center><font face="Arial" color="#000000">On Saturday morning, January 
  24, Brothers Walter W. Wetherington III (Yes, they <i>are</i> related. Woody 
  Raised his son during the degree) and Charles Robert French Sr., were Raised 
  to the Sublime Degree of a Master Mason.<br>
  Past Master Marvin Grover conferred both of the Degrees. This degree was very 
  well attended, with Brothers coming from as far as Irving and Seagoville.</font></P>
<P align=center><font face="Arial" color="#000000">Come on out on a Monday and/or 
  Thursday night for practice and Fellowship. We have more Degrees coming up we'll 
  need help with.</font></P>
