<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>The recapture of Galveston by Confederate 
forces is little known in the annals of war. But Masons, wherever dispersed, 
take a special pride and share a certain feeling when the war stood still in 
Galveston while Worshipful Master Philip C. Tucker, Jr. opened Harmony Lodge No. 
6 and conducted the Masonic burial of a Northern Brother, "appreciating the 
spirit and force of Masonic ties." It is a Masonic legacy for all Masons to 
cherish until time shall be no more.</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>By way of background, the Union Navy 
established a blockade of Port Galveston on October 6, 1862. Later, on Christmas 
Day, Federal troops landed and placed the entire island under Northern control. 
In the meantime, Texas gained a battle-tested hero as Confederate General John 
Bankhead Magruder, nicknamed "Prince John" for his dramatic flair and 
goldbraided pomp, was transferred to command the War Department of Texas, New 
Mexico and Arizona on October 10, 1862.</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>General Magruder, a West Pointer, had been 
thrice promoted in the Mexican War for "gallant and meritorious conduct" and was 
credited with directing and winning the first land battle in the Civil War for 
Southern Independence. Describing the battle, the Richmond Dispatch reported 
that Magruder had met a flag of truce in the conflict and granted the removal of 
a slain Federal officer. In parting, he had shaken hands with a Union Lieutenant 
and said, "We part as friends, but on the field of battle we meet as enemies." 
Although politicians might differ, General Magruder had expressed the feeling of 
most Masons and most combat soldiers of either North or South. And, it is 
interesting to note that Magruder had become an Entered Apprenticed Mason in San 
Diego Lodge No. 35 while stationed in California after the Mexican War, but his 
advancement was stopped due to a duel with the Lodge Treasurer.</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>When General Magruder arrived in Texas, he 
recognized that the economy of the state was held hostage by Union blockades 
along the Texas coast and immediately planned a land/sea attack to retake 
Galveston Island. In preparation, two small steamboats -the </B><B><I>Bayou 
City</I></B><B> and the </B><B><I>Neptune</I></B><B> - were fitted with guns and 
armored with bales of cotton which Magruder said gave "an appearance of 
protection" to the volunteers who manned them. Then, under cover of New Year's 
Eve night of 1862, the cotton-clad boats with makeshift tenders cruised to 
rendezvous with eight Northern ships in Galveston Harbor. At the same time a 
land force of Texas volunteers secretly crossed Galveston Bay on the railway 
bridge that still connected the island to the mainland and stationed themselves 
in a semicircle around Kuhn's Wharf where Union troops were garrisoned. No 
doubt, the Union soldiers were startled from sleep about three o'clock in the 
morning on New Year's Day, 1863, when General Magruder fired the first cannon 
shot as a signal for the Battle of Galveston to begin. After firing the cannon, 
a little of "Prince John" slipped out as a jovial Magruder remarked to his 
closeby troops, "Now I've done my duty as a private and I will go now and attend 
my duties as a General."</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>The outcome of the battle centered around the 
Union ship </B><B><I>Harriet Lane</I></B><B>, a copper-sheathed gunboat 
commanded by Commander Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, Jr., the forty-one year old 
son of Protestant Episcopal Bishop Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, Sr. of New York 
and the grandfather of Masonic General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright III of World 
War 11 fame.&nbsp;&nbsp; The second in command was&nbsp; Lieutenant Commander 
Edward Lea, a graduate of the United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Md., in 
1855, and a family relation of Margaret Moffette Lea Houston, wife of the 
Masonic General Sam Houston.</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>Upon entering the harbor, the </B><B><I>Bayou 
City</I></B><B> and </B><B><I>Neptune</I></B><B> opened fire and attempted to 
ram the </B><B><I>Harriet Lane</I></B><B>. The </B><B><I>Harriet Lane</I></B><B> 
returned fire in like kind and sank the </B><B><I>Neptune </I></B><B>in the 
shallow bay. Finally, the Bayou City managed to ram the </B><B><I>Harriet 
Lane</I></B><B> in such a way that the vessels locked together. At this time the 
</B><B><I>Harriet Lane</I></B><B> was boarded and captured during hand-to-hand 
combat. Following the seizure of the Harriet Lane, a flag of truce was sent to 
the Union Commodore Renshaw whose flagship </B><B><I>Westfield</I></B><B> had 
run aground. In truce, General Magruder demanded surrender of the entire fleet 
and gave three hours for consideration, After demands were met, the Northern 
ships were brought to anchor, flying the white flags of truce. In this interim, 
Commodore Renshaw was killed in an explosion that he set to scuttle his flagship 
</B><B><I>Westfield</I></B><B> and the Union gunboats, 
</B><B><I>Clifton</I></B><B> and </B><B><I>Owasco</I></B><B>, steamed from the 
harbor with their white flags still flying. Seeing they were abandoned by their 
fleeing fleet, the Union soldiers fighting at Kuhn's Wharf accepted 
unconditional surrender. The Battle of Galveston was over and the Island 
remained in Southern control until the end of the Confederate Nation.</B> 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>At the time the Confederates boarded the 
</B><B><I>Harriet Lane</I></B><B> both Wainwright and Lea refused to surrender 
and both fought valiantly to save their ship. Commander Wainwright 
sustained&nbsp; injuries to his head and left thigh before he was killed by a 
shot to the head from the Mason,&nbsp; Commodore Leon Smith, Commander of the 
</B><B><I>Bayou City</I></B><B> and a brother of Past Grand Master&nbsp; of 
Indiana Caleb B. Smith who served as Secretary of the Interior in Lincoln's 
first cabinet. Mortally wounded, Lieutenant Commander Edward Lea lay dying on 
the ship deck. When the Confederate Major Albert Miller Lea boarded the ship, he 
recognized his son Edward, whom he had not seen since the war began, and rushed 
to comfort him. As he knelt by his son, Edward, barely conscious, whispered to a 
shipmate, "My father is here."&nbsp; Then, he died.</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>Masonic prisoners from the </B><B><I>Harriet 
Lane</I></B><B> vouched to Confederate Masons that Wainwright was a Mason in 
good standing. Although they asked nothing for themselves, they requested a 
Masonic burial for their late Commander and Masonic Brother. When this 
information reached Philip C. Tucker, Jr., a Major on Magruder's staff and 
Worshipful Master of Harmony Lodge No. 6 in Galveston, plans were made to open 
the Lodge for Masonic burial.</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>As soon as Brother Tucker reported to the 
Confederate headquarters located in the Roman Catholic Bishop's palace, General 
Magruder accosted him with: "Major Tucker, I hear you&nbsp; intend to bury the 
remains of Commander Wainwright tomorrow with Masonic honors. Is this true?" 
Major Tucker saluted and answered, "Yes, Sir. And I hope General Magruder will 
give it military honors."&nbsp;&nbsp; The reply was, "Who in H--l ever heard of 
burying a dead enemy with Masonic and military honors?"&nbsp;&nbsp; The response 
was, "General Magruder, when Lieutenant Colonel Rogers of the Second Texas fell, 
the Federal authorities gave the body Masonic and military burial (unconfirmed), 
and it is said that you are never to be outdone in courtesy to a friend or 
enemy."&nbsp;&nbsp; The rebuttal was, "Not by a d---d sight.&nbsp; Colonel 
DeBray (a Mason and former Secretary of Austin Lodge No. 12), turn out your 
regiment for escort duty tomorrow at the Masonic burial of Lieutenant Commander 
Wainwright of the </B><B><I>Harriet Lane."</I></B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>On January 2, 1863, Harmony Lodge opened and 
resolved, "that the members of this Lodge, appreciating the spirit and force of 
Masonic ties, will not allow their feelings and prejudice and love of righteous 
cause to obliterate from their hearts and minds the merciful teachings of the 
Order; that it does not conflict with their duties as patriotic citizens to 
respond to calls of mercy by a prostrate political foe, or to administer the 
last rite of the Order to the remains of a Mason of moral worth, although 
yesterday&nbsp; they met as an armed enemy in mortal combat in which the 
deceased parted with his life-,..."</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>The Lodge minutes continue, "Whereupon the 
Lodge was called upon to bury the dead. A public procession formed in which 
appeared both friends and foes wearing the insignia of the Order, and 
accompanied with a proper military escort under the command of Col. and Brother 
H. B. Debray, among which was the Major General Commanding J. Bankhead Magruder. 
The body of Bro. Wainwright was borne to its grave in the Episcopal Cemetery 
where it was deposited with rites of Masons and military. Lodge called from 
burying the dead and closed in due form."</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>Although the preceding quotes do not include 
reference to Lieutenant Commander Lea, his body was borne to the cemetery and 
buried in a single grave with Commander Wainwright.&nbsp; In his official report 
of the Battle of Galveston to President Jefferson Davis, the Entered Apprentice 
Mason General Magruder wrote, "Captain Wainwright and Lieutenant Lea of the 
Federal Navy were buried with Masonic and military honors in the same grave; 
Major Lea, of the Confederate Army, father of Lieutenant Lea, performing the 
funeral service." In addition, the book </B><B><I>History of DeBray's 
Regiment</I></B><B> includes the statement, "the bodies of Lieutenant Commander 
Wainwright, killed in action, and of Lieutenant Lea were buried in the Galveston 
Cemetery with military and Masonic honors, the Confederate father reading over 
his Federal son's grave the solemn funeral service of the Episcopal Church. The 
witnesses of that heart-rending scene can never forget it."</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>After graduation from West Point, Albert 
Miller Lea was assigned to frontier duty at Fort Des Moines on topographical 
duty. Later, his published notes gave the state of Iowa its name. Although the 
Grand Lodge of Iowa has no record of Masonic membership for Albert Miller Lea, 
it supplied an article of the Iowa Historical Society written by Lea just before 
his death. The article confirms his service in the Battle of Galveston and 
states, "I met in battle my oldest son, and said the Grand Service of the Church 
over his Captain, Wainwright, son of the late Bishop of New York, and himself, 
buried in one grave."</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>Since Lea makes no mention of the Masonic 
burial of his son, perhaps it is more correct to put on record that Harmony 
Lodge extended the courtesy of escorting both Wainwright and Lea to the 
cemetery, conducted the Masonic burial of Wainwright, and attended the Episcopal 
Church service that committed both Federal officers to rest in a single grave. 
Following the war, the body of Wainwright was moved to New York and interred 
near his father, Bishop Wainwright, in the cemetery of Trinity Church.&nbsp; No 
mention is discovered whether the honor of Masonic burial was conducted during 
this second burial.</B> </FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>July 9, 1994, marks the hundredth 
year since Philip C. Tucker, Jr. walked among Masonic Brothers. Yet, his Masonic 
labors live on and his achievements continue to strengthen Freemasonry in 
general, and in Texas, in particular.</B> </FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>Brother Tucker was born on 
February 14, 1826, in Vergennes, Vermont. There he spent his early life and was 
educated as an attorney by reading law in his father's office and beginning 
practice under his father's guidance.&nbsp; Upon attaining the age of 
twenty-one, Philip was raised a Mason in Dorchester Lodge in 1847. During the 
next five years, he worked three years as assistant Grand Secretary, served 
twice as Worshipful Master of Dorchester Lodge, and was District Deputy Grand 
Master for three terms. In addition, he joined York Rite Freemasonry and served 
as Thrice Illustrious Master of his Council.</B> </FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>In 1852, just as he turned 
twenty-six years old, Brother Tucker moved to Galveston, Texas, where he 
established a successful law practice, became active in the Trinity Episcopal 
Church, was a community leader and affiliated with Harmony Lodge and the York 
Rite Bodies in Galveston. Later, he affiliated with Tucker Lodge No. 297 that 
was named in his honor. He was Worshipful Master of Harmony for six years, 
Commander of San Felipe Commandery for fourteen years, and served as High Priest 
of San Felipe Chapter.</B> </FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>In Grand Bodies, he became Grand 
Commander of the Grand Commandery of Texas in 1864, Grand High Priest of the 
Grand Royal Arch Chapter of Texas in 1865, and Grand Master of the Grand Lodge 
of Texas in 1869.</B> </FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>His continued enthusiasm for 
Masonry prompted Brother Tucker to accept an invitation from Grand Commander 
Albert Pike of the Supreme Council, 33°, of the Southern Jurisdiction of the 
Scottish Rite of Freemasonry to become involved in introducing the Scottish Rite 
System of Freemasonry into Texas. On February 4-5, 1867, Brother Tucker traveled 
to New Orleans where the Scottish Rite degrees were communicated to him by 
dispensation from Grand Commander Pike. At the same time, he was commissioned as 
Deputy Grand Inspector General in Texas. Later, on May 17, 1867, Deputy Grand 
Inspector General Tucker granted Letters Temporary for the organization of San 
Felipe de Austin Lodge of Perfection in Galveston, Texas.</B> </FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>Grand Inspector General Tucker was 
an active and productive member of the Supreme Council in Washington, D.C., and 
on July 28, 1893, he was elected as Grand Commander. At the age of sixty-seven, 
he moved to Washington to perform the duties of Grand Commander. But, 
unfortunately, his tenure was suddenly terminated by death on July 9, 1894. His 
body was returned home to Galveston and buried with Masonic honors not far from 
the grave in which he placed Lieutenant Commanders Wainwright and Lea and where 
Lieutenant Lea still rests.</B> </FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>Brother Tucker was essential to 
the fulfillment of the Masonic legacy when the war stood still in Galveston. 
Apparently, under his leadership in the years of the Civil War for Southern 
Independence, Harmony Lodge is the only Lodge, North or South, to conduct the 
Masonic burial service for a Mason killed in mortal combat as an enemy.</B> 
</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>What pride and respect we hold for 
the masons of yesteryear who held Masonry firm and stable, "appreciating the 
spirit and force of Masonic ties," while states separated, churches divided and 
families split over political differences.</B> </FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>As word of the planned Masonic 
burial spread over town, most citizens and some Masons denounced it as "Treason 
to the Confederacy." And certainly, discussion of Tucker's birth up North added 
fuel to the beginning fire which was quickly quenched when Magruder added&nbsp; 
support to Tucker and the Lodge by taking military honors to the burial service. 
No one could accuse General Magruder with "Treason to the Confederacy" and, 
suddenly, the Masonic burial with military honors seemed the thing to do.</B> 
</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>General Magruder had a sad life 
following the war. Instead of surrendering, he went to Mexico and served as a 
general in the army of Maximilian. After the defeat of Maximilian, he returned 
to Houston. There, almost in poverty, he died in 1871 and was buried in the 
cemetery lot of a friend. Later, spirited citizens of Galveston wanted Magruder 
buried on the Island he saved. They had his body moved to Galveston where it 
waited for several years in a funeral vault for enough money to be contributed 
for final interment.</B> </FONT><BR><FONT size=4><STRONG></STRONG></FONT></P>
