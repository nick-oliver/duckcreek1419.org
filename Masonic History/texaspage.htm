<P align=center><FONT color=#ffffff size=3>To separate the Grand Lodge of the 
Republic of Texas from the Republic of Texas is not easily accomplished. Since a 
large number of the participants were Masons, it is akin to watching plays on 
two stages with the same actors scurrying back and forth. Independence from 
Mexico had been won at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836, and during 
the next months the infant republic struggled to establish itself.</FONT></P>

articles regarding Houston's treatment of Santa Anna at San Jacinto, reportedly

permit the execution of Santa Anna to his having given Houston the Masonic sign 
of Distress.</FONT></P>

<P align=center><FONT color=#ffffff>During his year (1998), Grand Master Harry 
G, Cunningham had as his emblem the Alamo Mission overlaid with the Square and 
Compasses. This emblem should hold special meaning to all Texas Masons. The 
Alamo should be remembered as the place where the Mexican Army, under command of 
General Antonio Lopez De Santa Anna, stormed a former Mexican mission defended 
by a band of Texans fighting for their independence. Among the defenders were 
our Masonic Brothers James Bonham, Jim Bowie, David Crockett, Almaron Dickenson 
and Col. William Barrett Travis.</FONT></P>

<P align=center><FONT color=#ffffff size=3>The recapture of Galveston by 
Confederate forces is little known in the annals of war. But Masons, wherever 
dispersed, take a special pride and share a certain feeling when the war stood 
still in Galveston while Worshipful Master Philip C. Tucker, Jr. opened Harmony 
Lodge No. 6 and conducted the Masonic burial of a Northern Brother, 
"appreciating the spirit and force of Masonic ties." It is a Masonic legacy for 
all Masons to cherish until time shall be no more. </FONT></P>

<P align=center><FONT color=#ffffff>The subject of our last month's newsletter 
was "Texas Masonic Pride" which outlined the history of the Great State of Texas 
and the Masons who shaped its course of history. The month of March commemorated 
many of the historical events, such as the time in 1835 when five Master Masons 
met beneath an oak tree in Brazoria and petitioned the Grand Master of Louisiana 
for a charter to form a lodge in Texas. Then on March 2, 1836, Sam Houston and 
58 other delegates drafted and signed the Declaration of Independence from 
Mexico, knowing that they might well be signing their own death warrants. The 
Alamo fell on March 6, 1836.&nbsp; That was also the day when Sam Houston was 
appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Texas Army and took command of the 
troops.</FONT></P>
