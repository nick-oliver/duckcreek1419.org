WE&nbsp; "REMEMBER&nbsp; THE&nbsp; ALAMO"</B></FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
color=#ff0000> </FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman"><BR>by Bro. Dwight Stevens, 
Chairman, Masonic Education and Service Committee <BR></FONT><FONT

1998,)</FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman"> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>During his year (1998), Grand 
Master Harry G, Cunningham had as his emblem the Alamo Mission overlaid with the 
Square and Compasses. This emblem should hold special meaning to all Texas 
Masons. The Alamo should be remembered as the place where the Mexican Army, 
under command of General Antonio Lopez De Santa Anna, stormed a former Mexican 
mission defended by a band of Texans fighting for their independence. Among the 
defenders were our Masonic Brothers James Bonham, Jim Bowie, David Crockett, 
Almaron Dickenson and Col. William Barrett Travis.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>In rooms where priests had 
prayed, bayonets clashed with Bowie Knives and swords. Musket and cannon fire 
tore into the Texan defenders, By dawn, all the Texan combatants lay dead. Their 
sacrifice, on March 6, 1836, would immortalize them as legends, and turn the 
Alamo grounds into Sacred Ground.</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>Each year more than three 
million Americans visit the Alamo. For many of the visitors, who gaze with 
reverence at the paintings and exhibits, the Alamo is more shrine than historic 
monument. They have come to the Alamo to honor those&nbsp; whose death gave 
birth to a Republic.</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>Brother William Barrett Travis, 
Commander of the Alamo garrison, is said to have drawn a line in the sand 
requesting all who would stay and fight to: "step across the line." He drew that 
line not only in the sand, but into the hearts and minds of every Texas 
Mason,</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>Many months after the battle, 
the charred remains of the Alamo defenders were laid to rest not far from the 
Alamo itself, Presiding at the ceremony was Brother Juan Sequin. The words he 
spoke at the interment speak to us even today,</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>"The spirit of liberty appears 
to be looking down from it's elevated throne saying:&nbsp; Behold your Brothers: 
Crockett, Bowie, Travis. They preferred to die a thousand times rather than 
submit themselves to the tyrants yoke, Their sacrifices are worthy of inclusion 
in the pages of history. What a brilliant example for others to follow."</B> 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>If you have not had the 
opportunity to visit the Alamo, please do so at your earliest possible 
convenience. The Daughter's of the Republic of Texas have lovingly turned the 
Alamo Mission into a shrine, It remains to this day a shrine to the heroes of 
Texas liberty. The veneration of the defenders reached a new height in 1939 with 
the dedication of The Alamo Cenotaph. Towering sixty feet above the Alamo, the 
monument's theme is: "The Spirit of Sacrifice". Statues of the principal 
defenders, and the names of all the Texans who died at the Alamo, are carved 
into the granite foundation,</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>During your visit, you will 
find that the Alamo is a powerful place. It's a place filled with legends and 
memories, It's a place we all should go think about our own potential, about 
what we need to sacrifice so that we can keep the fraternity on the road that 
those men fought to preserve.</B></FONT></P>
