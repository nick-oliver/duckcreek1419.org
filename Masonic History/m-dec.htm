<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>To separate the Grand Lodge of 
the Republic of Texas from the Republic of Texas is not easily accomplished. 
Since a large number of the participants were Masons, it is akin to watching 
plays on two stages with the same actors scurrying back and forth. Independence 
from Mexico had been won at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836, and 
during the next months the infant republic struggled to establish itself.</B> 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>As 1837 dawned, the Treasury 
was almost devoid of funds, plans for the defense of the republic had hardly 
begun, and the economy was shaky. Yet, it was a society full of hope, a society 
still predominantly masculine. As historian Archie McDonald put it, "Masonry in 
such a society could perform many functions, including that of fraternity for 
lonely men, and it could act as a force for morality for men without other, more 
ordinary, restraint."</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>Anson Jones had returned to 
Houston and re-opened Holland Lodge No. 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Milan Lodge No. 2 at 
Nacogdoches and McFarland Lodge No. 3 at San Augustine had formed.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
In November, 1837, Holland Lodge passed a resolution inviting the lodges at 
Nacogdoches and San Augustine to meet with Holland Lodge in Houston on the 27th 
of December for the purpose of forming a Grand Lodge.</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>The assembly actually was held 
on December 20 in the Senate Chamber of the capitol building with Sam Houston 
presiding. Anson Jones moved that the several lodges "consider it a matter of 
right, and for the general benefit of the Order" to organize themselves "into a 
Grand Lodge within the Republic, and that they now proceed to organize the Grand 
Lodge of the Republic of Texas, and the Masonic Jurisdication there unto 
belonging." The motion passed unanimously.&nbsp;&nbsp; Adolphus Sterne of Milan 
Lodge then moved that all Master Masons present be made members of the Grand 
Lodge, and, in a second motion, that they proceed to elect Grand 
Officers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anson Jones was elected Grand Master.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
rules and by-laws of the Grand Lodge of Louisiana were adopted "for present 
government so far as it is applicable to our situation," and a committee was 
appointed to draft a Constitution.</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>At the first communication of 
the Grand Lodge held in April 1838, the Constitution of the Grand Lodge of 
Tennessee was adopted "with such changes in its regulations and phraseology as 
will adapt it to the local conditions and wants of this Grand Lodge."&nbsp; No 
reason for switching from the Louisiana Constitution to that of Tennessee was 
given.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the committee appointed to draft a Constitution 
continued its work, and on 19 May 1838, the Grand Lodge of the Republic of Texas 
adopted its own Constitution.</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>&nbsp;From three small but 
all-important lodges sprang what was to become a mighty Grand Lodge, the Masonic 
heritage of which had followed a clear path.&nbsp; Out of the Ancient Grand 
Lodge of England came the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania which in turn chartered 
four of the five lodges that formed the Grand Lodge of Louisiana;&nbsp; and out 
of that body came the charters for the original three lodges in Texas.&nbsp; 
Like its forebears, the Constitution of the Texas Grand Lodge stated that its 
members were Ancient York Rite Masons practicing Masonry as it was agreed to at 
York, England, in 926 A.D.&nbsp; The words"York Rite Masons" were dropped from 
the Constitution in 1858, and since that time we have been Ancient Free and 
Accepted Masons. In 1846, the "Act to Incorporate the Society of Free Masons, 
composed of Lodges and Chapters" was adopted.&nbsp; Finally, in 1849, came the 
"Act to Incorporate the Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, in and 
for the State of Texas, under and by the name and style of the Grand Lodge of 
Texas," and so it has been ever since.</B></FONT></P>
