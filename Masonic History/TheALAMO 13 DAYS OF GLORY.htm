<H3>MYSTERIES, MYTHS AND TEXAS-SIZE LEGENDS SURROUND THE FORTIFIED SPANISH 
MISSION THAT BECAME A SHRINE AFTER A FEW GOOD MEN VALIANTLY DEFENDED IT TO THE 
DEATH 160 YEARS AGO.<BR><B>BY LEE PAUL</B></H3></CENTER>
<P>FEBRUARY 23, 1836, began the siege of the Alamo, a 13-day moment in history 
that turned a ruined Spanish mission in the heart of downtown San Antonio, 
Texas, into a shrine known and revered the world over. But what is it that makes 
this one battle so different from any other battle fought in the name of 
freedom? The people involved? Yes, that's part of it. The issues at hand? Yes, 
that's another part. Or can it be that the mysteries, myths and legends 
surrounding it are still tantalizing minds even today? Yes. Yes. Yes. All of 
these things have made the battle stand apart and have caused it to be so well 
remembered throughout the nation 160 years later. Yet, as historian Walter Lord 
said in 1960, "It is...a rash man indeed who claims he has the final answer to 
everything that happened at the Alamo." 
<P>History records three revolutions that led to the Battle of the Alamo. The 
first, the Spanish revolt against French occupation of Spain, occurred in 1808. 
Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Spain, and it took six years for Spanish resistance 
forces to oust the French emperor and restore Ferdinand VII to the throne. The 
fires of the Spanish revolt crossed the ocean, and in Mexico Father Miguel 
Hidalgo rang the bells of his small church in Dolores at midnight on September 
15, 1810, to herald the beginning of the second revolution. This Mexican revolt 
against Spanish occupation traveled quickly across Mexico and into the northern 
frontier of the Mexican territory of Texas. San Antonio de Béxar, the capital of 
Texas, became a center of revolutionary activity and a haven for resistance 
fighters. One revolutionary, Captain Jose Menchaca, was captured by Spanish 
troops, shot and beheaded. His head was then stuck on a pole in front of the 
Alamo. Instead of setting an example for the other insurgents, however, 
Menchaca's execution only added fuel to the revolt. 
<P>After an 11-year struggle, Mexico gained its freedom in 1821. Within that 
same year, Agustin de Iturbide, a Spanish general turned rebel and a hero of the 
revolution, became emperor of the new nation. But his regime was too extravagant 
for some tastes, and in no time a revolt led by General Antonio López de Santa 
Anna brought about Iturbide's downfall and established a Mexican republic. 
<P>Under Iturbide, American colonists had been allowed to settle in Texas. About 
the only condition to owning land was that all immigrant landowners had to be 
Catholic, an easy enough problem to overcome for non-Catholics. William Travis, 
for instance, became Catholic to purchase land, but remained a staunch Methodist 
until the day he died at the Alamo. 
<P>Unfortunately, the fledgling Republic of Mexico was born bankrupt and 
ill-prepared for self-government. In fact, during its first 15 years of 
independence, it had 13 presidents. All of them struggled for power, shifting 
between the liberal-leaning Federalists and the dictatorial Centralists. The 
first president was a Federalist, General Guadalupe Victoria, a hero of the 
revolution who had changed his name from Miguel Felix Hernandez to honor Our 
Lady of Guadalupe, patroness of the Americas, for his victory. It was he who 
established the liberal Constitution of 1824 that so infuriated Santa Anna and 
that would lead to the Battle of the Alamo 12 years later. 
<P>It was also during this tumultuous struggle for control of Mexico's 
presidency that the northern territory of Texas was mostly neglected. When 
Mexico redefined its territories in 1824, Texas was the only separate territory 
to lose its independence. It was joined to Coahuila and the capital was moved 
from San Antonio de Béxar to Saltillo. Armed citizens gathered in protest. In 
September 1835, they petitioned for statehood separate from Coahuila. They wrote 
out their needs and their complaints in <I>The Declaration of Causes.</I> This 
document was designed to convince the Federalists that the Texans desired only 
to preserve the 1824 Constitution, which guaranteed the rights of everyone 
living on Mexican soil. But by this time, Santa Anna was in power, having seized 
control in 1833, and he advocated the removal of all foreigners. His answer was 
to send his crack troops, commanded by his brother-in-law, General Martín 
Perfecto de Cós, to San Antonio to disarm the Texans. 
<P>October 1835 found San Antonio de Béxar under military rule, with 1,200 
Mexican troops under General Cós' command. When Cós ordered the small community 
of Gonzales, about 50 miles east of San Antonio, to return a cannon loaned to 
the town for defense against Indian attack--rightfully fearing that the citizens 
might use the cannon against his own troops--the Gonzales residents refused. 
"Come and take it!" they taunted, setting off a charge of old chains and scrap 
iron, shot from the mouth of the tiny cannon mounted on ox-cart wheels. Although 
the only casualty was one Mexican soldier, Gonzales became enshrined in history 
as the "Lexington of Texas." The Texas Revolution was on. 
<P>On December 5, 200 Texan volunteers commanded by Ben Milam attacked Cós' 
troops in San Antonio de Béxar, which was about 400 yards from the Alamo 
compound. The fighting in Béxar raged with a house-to-house assault unlike 
anything the Mexican army had ever before experienced. Cós finally flew the 
white flag of surrender from the Alamo on December 9. More than 200 of his men 
lay dead, and as many more were wounded. He signed papers of capitulation, 
giving the Texans all public property, money, arms and ammunition in San 
Antonio, and by Christmas Day, the Mexican army was back across the Rio Grande. 
To the Texans, who lost about 20 men, including Ben Milam, the victory seemed 
cheap and easy. 
<P>The siege of Béxar and Cós' surrender brought immediate retaliation from 
Santa Anna. He whipped together a force of 8,000 men, many of them foreign 
adventurers from Europe and America. One of his deadliest snipers was an 
Illinois man named Johnson! Santa Anna, the self-styled "Napoleon of the West," 
marched at the head of the massive army; he was determined to stamp out all 
opposition and teach the Texans a lesson. The word went out to his generals: "In 
this war, you understand, there are no prisoners." 
<P>Although it was midwinter, Santa Anna pushed his army mercilessly toward 
Texas. The frigid, wind-battered deserts of northern Mexico took their toll. Men 
and animals died by the hundreds and were left on the trail, and the brigades 
strung out for uncounted miles. When the big siege guns bogged down in one of 
the many quagmires, Santa Anna pushed on without them. Nothing would stop him. 
Meanwhile, after the defeated Mexican force under General Cós had left San 
Antonio, Colonel James C. Neill had assumed command of the Alamo garrison, which 
consisted of about 80 poorly equipped men in several small companies, including 
the volunteers. The rest of the soldiers had returned home to their families and 
farm chores. In this command were an artillery company under Captain William R. 
Carey known as the Invincibles, two small infantry companies known as the New 
Orleans Greys under Captain William Blazeby, and the Béxar Guards under Captain 
Robert White. 
<P>On January 17, 1836, Sam Houston, the commander of the revolutionary troops, 
sent Colonel Jim Bowie and 25 men to San Antonio with orders to destroy the 
Alamo fortifications and retire eastward with the artillery. But Bowie and Neill 
agreed that it would be impossible to remove the 24 captured cannons without 
oxen, mules or horses. And they deemed it foolhardy to abandon that much 
firepower--by far the most concentrated at any location during the Texas 
Revolution. Bowie also had a keen eye for logistics, terrain, and avenues of 
assault. Knowing that General Houston needed time to raise a sizable army to 
repel Santa Anna, Bowie set about reinforcing the Alamo after Neill was forced 
to leave because of sickness in his family. 
<P>Colonel William Travis arrived in San Antonio on February 2 with a small 
cavalry company, bringing the total number of Alamo defenders to about 130. 
Although spies told him that Santa Anna had crossed the Rio Grande, Travis did 
not expect the dictator before early spring. He sent letter after letter, 
pleading for supplies and more men. He and Bowie also competed for command of 
the garrison before it was decided that Bowie would command the volunteers and 
Travis the regular army. On February 9, David Crockett and the 14 other 
Tennessee Mounted Volunteers (only three were actually from Tennessee) rode into 
San Antonio. Alarmed by the Mexican army on the outskirts of town, Travis 
vigorously renewed his pleas for help. His February 24 letter, "To the People of 
Texas and All Americans in the World....I shall never surrender or 
retreat....Victory or Death!" is considered one of the most heart-wrenching 
pleas ever written. Travis sent the message out with Captain Albert Martin. 
<P>The day before, February 23, Santa Anna had reclaimed San Antonio. To the 
triumphant music of a military band, he took possession of the town, set up 
headquarters on the main plaza, and began the siege. He had his standard-bearers 
climb to the top of the bell tower of San Fernando Church and unfurl the scarlet 
flag of "no quarter." Inside the Alamo, Travis and the Texans fired their 
message to Santa Anna with a blast from their 18-pounder. They had their music, 
too, with Davy Crockett's fiddle and John McGregor's bagpipes. In fact, Davy's 
fiddle-playing and outlandish storytelling kept up the spirits of the besieged 
defenders. 
<P>Santa Anna ordered his men to pound the fortifications with cannon and rifle 
fire for 12 days and nights. His idea was to wear out the defenders inside, 
giving them no chance for rest or sleep. He reasoned that a weary army would be 
an easy one to defeat. But the noise worked on his own army, too. Unable to hear 
clearly through the din, they allowed courier after courier to escape from the 
Alamo. On March 2, racing through the enemy's lines, the last group to reinforce 
the Alamo arrived. These men were the relief force from Gonzales, the only town 
to answer Travis' pleas to send help. The total number of Alamo defenders now 
stood at between 180 and 190. 
<P>At 4 o'clock on the morning of March 6, 1836, Santa Anna advanced his men to 
within 200 yards of the Alamo's walls. Just as dawn was breaking, the Mexican 
bloodcurdling bugle call of the <I>Deguello </I>echoed the meaning of the 
scarlet flag above San Fernando: no quarter. It was Captain Juan Seguin's 
Tejanos, the native-born Mexicans fighting in the Texan army, who interpreted 
the chilling music for the other defenders. 
<P>Santa Anna's first charge was repulsed, as was the second, by the deadly fire 
of Travis' artillery. At the third charge, one Mexican column attacked near a 
breach in the north wall, another in the area of the chapel, and a third, the 
Toluca Battalion, commenced to scale the walls. All suffered severely. Out of 
800 men in the Toluca Battalion, only 130 were left alive. Fighting was hand to 
hand with knives, pistols, clubbed rifles, lances, pikes, knees and fists. The 
dead lay everywhere. Blood spilled in the convent, the barracks, the entrance to 
the church, and finally in the rubble-strewn church interior itself. Ninety 
minutes after it began, it was over. 
<P>All the Texans died. Santa Anna's loss was 1,544 men. More than 500 Mexicans 
lay wounded, their groans mingling with the haunting strains of the distant 
bugle calls. Santa Anna airily dismissed the Alamo conquest as "a small affair," 
but one of his officers commented, "Another such victory will ruin us." 
<P>As many of the Mexican dead as possible were given the rites of the church 
and buried, but there were so many that there was not sufficient room in the 
cemetery. Santa Anna ordered all the bodies of the Texans to be contemptuously 
stacked like cord wood in three heaps, mixed with fuel, wood and dry branches 
from the neighboring forest, and set on fire--except one. Jose Gregorio Esparza 
was given a Christian burial because his brother Francisco was a member of 
General Cós' presidio guards. 
<P>Six weeks after the Alamo, while the Mexican wounded still languished in San 
Antonio, Santa Anna met his Waterloo at San Jacinto. The men who died inside the 
walls of the Alamo had bought with their lives the time needed for General Sam 
Houston to weld a force that won Texas its independence. The great sacrifice 
would not be forgotten by history, nor would the Alamo's many legends and 
stories, most of which can never be proved or disproved because all the 
defenders died. 
<P>One of the most enduring questions is whether Travis really did draw a line 
in the earth, the "grand canyon of Texas," and ask all to step over who were 
willing to die for the cause. It is probably based on fact. Travis anticipated a 
battle to the death. Since he was also one for fairness, it's logical to believe 
that he would give the men an opportunity to leave the ill-fated garrison. It is 
a fact that one man did leave. Louis Rose was from France, and he had already 
served in one bloody war as a noncommissioned officer in Napoleon Bonaparte's 
army. Before the final assault on the Alamo he left, sustaining many leg wounds 
from cactuses and thorns during his escape that plagued him the remainder of his 
life. Asked why he chose not to stay with the rest, he replied, "By God, I 
wasn't ready to die." It is Rose's tale of the line in the dust that has become 
legend. 
<P>Two of Santa Anna's earliest opponents were Erasmo Seguin and his son Juan, 
of San Antonio. In fact, it was Juan who became one of the staunchest fighters 
for Texas freedom, forming his own band of Tejanos to stand alongside his Anglo 
counterparts. Juan Seguin was on a courier mission for Travis when the Alamo 
fell, but he vowed to one day honor the Alamo dead in a church ceremony, a 
ceremony that had been denied by Santa Anna. Legend claims that Seguin collected 
the ashes and placed them in a casket covered with black. Inside the lid, he had 
the names of Travis, Bowie and Crockett engraved. He then buried the casket. 
Where? No one knows. Shortly before his death, when he was in his 80s, Juan 
Seguin stated that he had buried the casket outside the sanctuary railing, near 
the steps in the old San Fernando Church. In 1936, repair work on the altar 
railing of the cathedral led to the unearthing of a box containing charred 
bones, rusty nails, shreds of uniforms and buttons, particles of coal, and 
crushed skulls. From that discovery arose a controversy that continues to this 
day. Are they the bones of the Alamo defenders? Many believe yes, but since the 
defenders did not wear uniforms, many others think not. 
<P>Questions also still remain about the death of David Crockett, who, without 
doubt, was the most famous defender of the siege. Shortly after the capture of 
Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto, rumors began to circulate that 
49-year-old Crockett had not died alongside his men in the final moments of the 
Alamo. Conflicting testimony claimed that Crockett and a handful of 
others--including Lieutenant James Butler Bonham, who rode back into the Alamo 
on March 3 knowing full well that it was a death trap--survived the siege, only 
to be destroyed on the orders of an enraged Santa Anna a few minutes later. 
True...or not? No one may ever really know. But most people prefer to believe 
that Crockett died a heroic death inside the Alamo. 
<P>Davy Crockett was a national folk hero long before the events of the Alamo. 
Born August 17, 1786, in an East Tennessee wilderness cabin in what is now 
Greene County, he struck out on his own at the tender age of 12 to help drive a 
herd of cattle to Virginia. By 1813, he was serving as one of General Andrew 
Jackson's scouts in the Creek War. He apparently did not enjoy fighting Indians 
and returned home as soon as his 90-day enlistment was up. In 1821, he was 
elected to the Tennessee Legislature for the first time, representing a district 
of 11 western counties in the state. He later served two terms in the United 
States Congress. 
<P>Crockett was always one for adventure. When defeated at the polls for a third 
term in Congress in 1835, he turned in typical Crockett fashion to the cause of 
Texan freedom as a way to completely cut off one phase of his life and begin 
another. Before leaving for Texas, however, he gave his constituents one last 
speech. He concluded "...by telling them that I was done with politics for the 
present, and that they might all go to hell, and I would go to Texas." After 
arriving in San Antonio in early February 1836, Crockett and the other Tennessee 
Mounted Volunteers eventually retreated into the Alamo. 
<P>The old fortress spread over three acres as it surrounded a rough rectangle 
of bare ground, about the size of a gigantic city block, called the plaza. On 
the south side of this plaza and detached from the church by a distance of some 
10 feet was a long one-story building called the "low barracks." Adobe huts 
spread along the west side, which was protected by a 12-foot-high stone wall. A 
similar wall ran across the north side. A two-story building called the "long 
barracks/convent/hospital" covered the east side, along with the church, which 
sat in the southeast corner, facing west. 
<P>Crockett and his men defended a low wooden palisade erected to breach the gap 
between the church and the low barracks of the south wall. The position of the 
low barracks was in front of, and perpendicular to, the right side of the 
church--an area that is now covered in flagstone. This palisade consisted of two 
rows of pointed wooden stakes with rocks and earth between the rows. All 
combatants considered the position to be the most vulnerable and hardest to 
defend area of the fortress. But Crockett and the other Tennesseans were expert 
marksmen, the best the small Texan army had. They most likely held their 
position until death. 
<P>As news of Crockett's death swept across America, some stories portrayed him 
as standing in the thickest of the fighting, using his trusty flintlock rifle 
"Old Betsy" like a club, until being cut down by Mexican bayonets and bullets. 
Well...maybe that's the way it really happened. Then again...maybe not. 
<P>Minutes after the fighting ceased, Santa Anna instructed Alcalde Francisco 
Ruiz to identify the bodies of the dead Texans, especially those of the leaders. 
According to the alcalde, "Toward the west and in a small fort opposite the 
city, we found the body of Colonel Crockett...and we may infer that he either 
commanded that point or was stationed there as a sharpshooter." The only logical 
explanation is that the small courtyard bounded by the palisade on the south, 
the church on the east and the hospital on the north, where Crockett and the 
Tennesseans were stationed, was considered a small fort all its own. 
<P>But one month later, the imprisoned General Cós told Dr. George Patrick that 
Davy Crockett had survived the battle. According to Cós, Crockett had locked 
himself in one of the rooms of the barracks. When the Mexican soldiers 
discovered him, Crockett explained that he was on a visit and "had accidentally 
got caught in the Alamo after it was too late to escape." Cós further said that 
Crockett wanted him to intercede with Santa Anna, asking for mercy, which Cós 
agreed to do--only Santa Anna had ordered "no quarter" and was incensed at such 
a request. The Mexican leader refused to spare Crockett's life. 
<P>In 1878, writer Josephus Conn Guild offered a similar version in which 
Crockett and five others survived the siege. When overrun by the Mexican 
soldiers, the Alamo survivors surrendered to General Manuel Castrillón under 
promise of his protection, "...but being taken before Santa Anna, they were by 
his orders instantly put to death. Colonel Crockett fell with a dozen swords 
sheathed in his breast." Actually, much of the same story had appeared as far 
back as 1836, when the diary of Lt. Col. José Enrique de la Peña was published 
in Mexico City. When the diary was finally published in English in the 1970s, it 
stirred up those Americans who felt the heroic Crockett never would have 
surrendered. 
<P>Another account, from Mexican Sergeant Felix Nunez, related details of the 
death of a Texan on the palisade: "He was a tall American of rather dark 
complexion and had a long buckskin coat and a round cap without any bill, made 
of fox skin with the long tail hanging down his back. This man apparently had a 
charmed life. Of the many soldiers who took deliberate aim at him and fired, not 
one ever hit him. On the contrary, he never missed a shot." He may not have been 
describing Davy Crockett, but who else dressed in that fashion? 
<P>Susanna Dickinson (sometimes spelled Dickerson), one of the noncombatant 
survivors of the battle, stated in her memoirs that she saw Crockett and a 
handful of others lying mangled and mutilated "between the church and the 
two-story barrack building, and even remembered seeing his peculiar cap laying 
by his side," as she was led from the scene by a Mexican officer. Perhaps she 
had seen Crockett after his execution, which supposedly occurred near the front 
of the church. But some people just won't buy a capture-execution scenario. And 
perhaps Reuben Marmaduke Potter had it right all along when he wrote, "David 
Crockett never surrendered to bear or tiger, Indian or Mexican." 
<P>There is also a controversial story about the Alamo's secondmost legendary 
figure (see "James Bowie's Knife" in the June 1994 issue of <I>Wild West</I>). 
That story, which has never been proved one way or the other, says that Bowie 
was the last to die in the fighting at the Alamo. 
<P>Jim Bowie, whose exploits made his name familiar in almost every American 
home during his lifetime, was born about 1796 (in either Tennessee, Kentucky, or 
Georgia--sources vary). When Jim was in his teens, the family settled at Bayou 
Boeuf, Rapides Parish, La., where he later operated a sugar plantation with his 
brother Rezin. It was his involvement with the pirate Jean Lafitte in the slave 
trade, though, that earned him a measure of notoriety. In September 1827, he 
killed a man with his huge knife during a brawl on a Mississippi sandbar just 
above Natchez. It was the Vidalia sandbar fight that firmly established him as a 
legendary fighter throughout the South. 
<P>Bowie left for Texas in 1828 to settle in San Antonio de Béxar, where his 
land dealings made him modestly wealthy almost overnight. Bowie also became a 
Mexican citizen and married into the Mexican aristocracy, which, more than 
anything else, gained him the friendship, confidence and support of the Mexican 
population. By 1831, he was fluent in Spanish. 
<P>Since he had been a colonel in a Texas Ranger company in 1830, he carried 
this title and authority when he answered the call for Texan volunteers. The 
40-year-old frontiersman and Indian fighter was described as a "normally calm, 
mild man until his temper was aroused." Absolutely fearless, he gave orders to 
the volunteers at the Alamo while 26-year-old Colonel Travis, a disciplinarian, 
took charge of the regulars and cavalry. The difference in their personalities, 
coupled with the difference in their ages, resulted in the two men sharing a 
somewhat antagonistic competition for command of the entire garrison. On one 
point they did agree: The Alamo was the most important stronghold of Texas. 
<P>Sometime around February 21, 1836, Bowie decided to help construct a lookout 
post or gun garrison along one of the walls. Although there are conflicting 
opinions on what actually happened, most accounts think that he lost his balance 
on the scaffold and fell 8 feet to the ground, breaking either his hip or his 
leg. This incident has also been called hogwash by other historians, who claim 
that Bowie never suffered any accident while at the Alamo. Whether or not he 
also suffered from tuberculosis, diphtheria, or the dreaded typhoid pneumonia is 
also a matter of conjecture. In any event, Bowie's incapacitation left Travis 
with full authority from that point onward. 
<P>Bowie took to his sick bed in the low barracks on or about the second day of 
the siege, and there's little doubt that he would have succumbed to his illness 
in a matter of days had not the Mexican soldiers dispatched him when they did. 
<P>On the final day of the 13-day siege, legend claims that it was Crockett who 
stole into Bowie's room and gave the sick man two pistols to be used for 
defense. Most accounts agree that Bowie was found dead on his cot, but since his 
nurse, Madame Candelaria, never told the exact same story twice about the 
sequence of events, who really knows what happened that day? Bowie probably 
participated in the battle, dying in the fall of the Alamo with the other 
defenders. But was he the last to fall? Everyone agrees that the last position 
to fall was the church, and Bowie wasn't even close to the church. As the 
Mexican soldiers stormed over the walls of the compound, the defenders raced to 
the long barracks, where there was no exit, and to the church. None of them 
ferried a sick man on a cot. 
<P>Still, the Mexican soldiers could have taken pity on Bowie when they saw him 
more dead than alive, prostrate on his cot in his room in the low barracks. In 
fact, an odd report claims that as the funeral pyres blazed high and soldiers 
heaped dead Texans on the pile, some soldiers carried out a man on a cot, a man 
the captain of the detail identified as "no other than the infamous Bowie." 
Although the man was still alive, Santa Anna ordered him thrown into the fire 
along with the rest. Would Santa Anna be so cruel? Yes, especially if the man 
were a Mexican citizen fighting in the Texan army. 
<P>Although the fact remains that no one knows why some 188 men chose to die on 
the plains of Texas in a ruined Spanish mission that required at least 1,200 men 
to adequately defend all its acreage, their sacrifice brought Texas 
independence, which paved the way for expansion to the Pacific and added more 
than a million square miles to the American nation at that time. And because of 
their sacrifice, the Alamo is now a shrine respected and revered throughout the 
world. "Remember the Alamo" became the battle cry that broke Santa Anna's back.

<H3>THE HISTORY OF THE ALAMO</H3></CENTER>
<P>There's an old rumor that suggests the mission now known as the Alamo isn't 
really <I>the </I>Alamo. Texans would like to see such rumors squashed. They 
know the Alamo always has been <I>the </I>Alamo. It just has another Christian 
name. 
<P>San Antonio has always been predominantly Spanish. In 1691, a Spanish 
missionary expedition stopped under a spreading cottonwood tree in central Texas 
and surveyed the surrounding hills and a gently flowing river. The military 
commander, Domingo Teran de los Rios, called the spot "the most beautiful part 
of New Spain." Father Damien Massanet agreed, and since it was June 13, the 
feast day of Saint Anthony, he promptly named it: "I call this place San Antonio 
de Padua, because it was his day." 
<P>Once back in Mexico, they talked of building a mission at the San Antonio de 
Padua site. Father Massanet insisted it should be a presidio, a fort built and 
manned by enough armed men to force respect for the missionaries. Shocked church 
authorities sent Father Massanet a letter, part of which said, "The [church] 
marvels at the proposal of violence and the use of the force of arms in the 
conversion of these savages to our holy faith...." 
<P>Seven years later, the Franciscan Seminary in Mexico City was mulling over 
the idea of building missions like stepping stones across the isolated outposts 
and the colonized parts of New Spain--with an army contingent, of course. In 
1699, construction began on San Juan Bautista on the Mexican side of the Rio 
Grande at Laredo. A presidio also went up nearby for the Spanish soldiers. On 
New Year's Day, 1700, San Francisco Solano was begun about 10 miles farther 
upriver. 
<P>By the time civilization crept into San Antonio de Padua in 1718, a new 
mission stood near the river. It was San Francisco Solano, moved from below the 
Rio Grande to its new site and renamed San Antonio de Valero, after the viceroy 
of New Spain, the <I>Marqués</I> de Valero. The San Antonio de Béxar presidio, 
named in honor of the viceroy's father, was built nearby. The area grew to 
become the capital of New Spain. 
<P>At first, the mission was situated on the east bank of the San Antonio River 
at the junction with San Pedro Creek, but when the river flooded a year later, 
the fathers wisely decided to move it to the west bank and farther away from the 
meandering course of the stream. Whiplash winds from one of the notorious Gulf 
Coast hurricanes flattened the flimsy structures, and the mission was moved once 
again, this time upstream and to the east side of the river where it now stands. 

<P>Twenty years later, the crumbling adobe walls were replaced with stone and 
the stone church was constructed, a measure that saved the fathers and Christian 
Indians within the fortifications of the church from certain death from 
marauding Apache on the warpath. Directly across the river on the west bank, the 
city of San Antonio de Béxar flourished around the presidio. 
<P>With the success of San Antonio de Valero, the river corridor through the 
central Texas hills all the way to the Gulf Coast soon became dotted with 
missions. One mission thought by the fathers of San Antonio de Valero to be in 
direct competition with their own lay not quite four miles downriver on the west 
bank. It was the customary practice to establish missions two leagues apart 
(about seven miles), but the fathers of Mission San Jose y San Miguel de Aguayo 
convinced the New Spain authorities that by following the twisting and turning 
San Antonio River, their mission <I>was </I>two leagues away. Ironically, San 
Jose y San Miguel de Aguayo was destined to be the "Queen of Missions" in 
Texas--until her shoddy sister upriver achieved infamy years later. 
<P>By 1758, the San Antonio area boasted five missions, all of which are within 
nine miles of each other and still in use today. One, Nuestra Senora de la 
Purísima Concepción, became the site of the Battle of Concepción (in October 
1835), in which Stephen Austin, Jim Bowie, James Fannin, Juan Seguin and a 
detachment of 90 volunteers took on a force of at least 230 regulars of the 
Mexican army under General Martín Perfecto de Cós. The Texans lost one man, the 
Mexican army about 60. 
<P>Eventually, the Spanish began secularizing their missions, beginning with San 
Antonio de Valero in 1793. When Mexico began its campaign for independence 10 
years later, Spanish troops from the city of San José y Santiago del Alamo de 
Parras moved into the now abandoned mission and stayed for many years. Since it 
was the common practice to identify the men by the full name of their town, and 
their town was named after a landmark cottonwood tree (<I>alamo</I> is Spanish 
for cottonwood) growing on a ranch near Parras, the Spanish soldiers became 
known as <I>"los Hombres del Alamo."</I> San Antonio de Valero became known as 
El Alamo. (Parras today is called Viesca and is located in Coahuila, Mexico.) 
<P>Whether or not this is the sole reason why the old fortress achieved such an 
informal name is still a matter of debate. Some claim the nickname really 
stemmed from the cottonwood trees that lined the river in front of the church. 
In any event, by the time the Texans got there, the old fortress had long been 
known as "the Alamo," although its official, Christian name is still San Antonio 
de Valero. <B>L.P.</B></P><P align=center>

Gonzales who made their way through the Mexican lines in answer to Travis plea 
for reinforcements, were colonists. Theirs was a fight against Santa Annas 
intolerable decrees. Others were volunteers such as David Crockett and his 
"Tennessee Boys" who owned nothing in Texas, and owed nothing to it. Theirs was 
a fight against tyranny wherever it might be. A handful were native Texans of 
Spanish and Mexican descent who suffered under the same injustices as the other

<P align=justify><FONT color=#004080>Now with the ammunition and supplies all

they concentrated their third attack at the battered north wall.</FONT></P>

<H1>The Fall of the Alamo</H1></CENTER><B>By Steve Goldman<BR>NCSA Member #9</B> 

<P>Most Americans are familiar with the battle cry "Remember the Alamo." This 
has come to be a rallying cry for people to come together with a common goal of 
avenging past injustices. The Alamo was burned into American consciousness over 
150 years ago in the town of San Antonio, then located in the Mexican province 
of Texas. 
<P>In 1835 the Anglo-American colonists in the Mexican province of Texas 
revolted against Mexican rule. They intended to separate Texas from Mexico and 
establish an independent Republic of Texas; however, the Mexican Central 
Government had other ideas. An expeditionary force of 6000 plus soldiers, led by 
General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, was sent to put down the rebellion and 
throw the American colonists out of Texas. 
<P>A force of 145 American (Texan) rebels, commanded by William Travis and James 
Bowie, gathered in the town of San Antonio. On February 23, 1836, General Santa 
Anna's army appeared on the out-skirts of San Antonio and the Texas rebels 
retreated into the stout-walled Alamo Mission within the town. Santa Anna 
demanded surrender. The Texans answered with a cannon shot, signaling defiance. 
Couriers rode out of the Alamo racing through Mexican lines with messages 
calling on all Texans to come aid them in this great struggle. The message from 
William Travis read in part: "... I have sustained a continued bombardment and 
cannonade for 24 hours and have not lost a man... Our flag still proudly waves 
from the wall. I shall never surrender or retreat... VICTORY OR DEATH." 
<P>Reinforcements were few and far between and by the eighth day of the siege 
the number of fighters in the Alamo numbered only 187. The siege went on for 13 
days. At 4 a.m. on the morning of March 6, 1836, the Mexicans led by Santa Anna 
stormed the Alamo. With bugles sounding the "Deguello" (signaling no quarter to 
the defenders) the Mexican troops attacked the adobe walls from all four sides. 
The first and second assaults were broken up. On the third try the Mexican 
soldiers breached the walls and a fierce battle ensued. The defenders fought 
fiercely from building to building and room to room but by 8 a.m. all 187 of the 
Texas troops were dead. This included such notables as Jim Bowie, William 
Travis, James Bonham and David Crockett. The cost for the Mexicans was high, as 
well over 1500 men were lost in the battle. 
<P>The first effect of the massacre was to sow panic throughout Texas among the 
Anglos. The Anglo civil population as well as the rebel government fled 
eastwards towards U.S. soil. Six weeks later, however, an army of Texas rebels, 
led by Sam Houston, defeated Santa Anna at San Jacinto. Houston rallied his men 
before the battle with an impassioned speech to "Remember the Alamo." This 
defeat of Santa Anna at San Jacinto established the independence of the Texas 
Republic. 
<P>News of the Fall of the Alamo was slow in reaching the outside world. Even 
though all of the Alamo's defenders were killed on March 6, 1836, a small group 
of women, children, and slaves were spared by General Santa Anna. Principle 
among them were Susan Dickinson, wife of slain defender Almeron Dickinson. She 
was released on March 11 and instructed by Santa Anna to travel by foot back to 
the Texas colonists at Gonzales. Once there she was told to spread the word -- 
resistance was hopeless and Texas must succumb to Mexican rules once again. By 
noon of March 13, Mrs. Dickinson was 20 miles from Gonzales when she met up with 
a Texan scouting party lead by "Deaf" Smith. The party was riding out from 
Gonzales to check on the Alamo and its defenders. Mrs. Dickinson gave the bare 
details where upon a scout named Henry Karnes dashed back to Gonzales to tell 
the others the bad news. 
<P>At Gonzales the news came as no surprise. On the evening of March 11 two 
Mexicans who lived near San Antonio turned up in town with the appalling news of 
the Fall of the Alamo. Even though they were not personally present at the 
massacre they were told of it by a Mexican friend who was nearby. At the time 
Sam Houston was unsure of whether or not to believe this second-hand report. 
However, that evening of the 13th when Mrs. Dickinson arrived, she confirmed the 
news and gave Houston a complete and detailed account of the Alamo's fate. 
<P>The first newspaper account of the Fall of the Alamo was in the Telegraph and 
Evening Register of March 17, 1836. The full details including the names of the 
dead were printed in the next issue, that of March 24, 1836. 
<P>The Telegraph and Texas Register was first issued at San Felipe de Austin on 
October 10, 1835. It was established by Gail Borden, Jr., Thomas H. Borden, and 
Joseph Baker. The Telegraph was published at San Felipe from October 10, 1835 
through March 24, 1836. With the Mexican invasion, the publisher fled with their 
press to Harrisburg, Texas where they published one issue, that of April 14, 
1836. As the first issues of that date were being printed, Mexican forces 
arrived in Harrisburg and threw the printing press into the local stream, 
Buffalo Bayou. The Borden's, however, escaped. Gail Borden traveled to 
Cincinnati, Ohio, where he purchased a new press. On August 1, 1836 the 
Telegraph was once again in print. Publication continued in Columbia from August 
1, 1836 through April 11, 1837 when once again it moved -- this time to Houston. 

<P>From initial reports in the Telegraph and Texas Register of March 17, 1836, 
the news of the Alamo spread throughout the country reaching the east coast 
newspapers during the second week of April. The eastern press headlined the news 
with large column heads: "IMPORTANT FROM TEXAS -- FALL OF SAN ANTONIO AND 
MASSACRE OF THE TEXIAN (sic) TROOPS." These sort of headlines crystallized 
support for the Texas settlers and helped contribute to further aid in 
establishing Texas as a republic.</P>
