<P align=center><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#cc0000 size=6><B>And the 
Texas Masonic Pride Goes On</B></FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman"> 
<BR></FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><I>from the Riverside 
Lodge No. 1194 Newsletter, April 1992, with permission</I> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>The subject of our last month's 
newsletter was "Texas Masonic Pride" which outlined the history of the Great 
State of Texas and the Masons who shaped its course of history. The month of 
March commemorated many of the historical events, such as the time in 1835 when 
five Master Masons met beneath an oak tree in Brazoria and petitioned the Grand 
Master of Louisiana for a charter to form a lodge in Texas. Then on March 2, 
1836, Sam Houston and 58 other delegates drafted and signed the Declaration of 
Independence from Mexico, knowing that they might well be signing their own 
death warrants. The Alamo fell on March 6, 1836.&nbsp; That was also the day 
when Sam Houston was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Texas Army and took 
command of the troops.</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>But the month of April 
commemorates the greatest event in the struggle for independence. This</B> 
<B>month's newsletter continues the theme of "Texas Masonic Ride ", and the 
events leading up to its</B> <B>independence. The following eight paragraphs are 
inscribed on the outer stone walls of the San Jacinto Monument:</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>"The early policies of Mexico 
toward her Texas Colonists had been extremely liberal. Large grants of land were 
made to them, and no taxes or duties imposed. The relationship between the 
Anglo-Americans and Mexicans was cordial. But, following a series of revolutions 
begun in 1829, unscrupulous rulers successively seized power in Mexico. Their 
unjust acts and despotic degrees led to the Revolution in Texas.</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>"In June 1832, the colonist 
forced the Mexican authorities at Anahuac to release William B. Travis and 
others from unjust imprisonment. The Battle of Velasco, June 26 and the Battle 
of Nacogdoches, August 2, followed. In both the Texans were victorious. Stephen 
Fuller Austin, "Father of Texas," was arrested January 3, 1834, and held in 
Mexico without trial until July 1835. The Texans formed an army, and on November 
12, 1835, established a provisional government.</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>"The first shot of the 
revolution of 1835-36 was fired by the Texans at Gonzales October 2, 1835, in 
resistance to a demand by Mexican soldiers for a small cannon held by the 
colonists. The Mexicans at Goliad fell October 9. The Battle of Concepcion was 
won by the Texans, October 28. San Antonio was captured October 10, 1835 after 
five days of fighting in which the indomitable Benjamin R. Milam died a hero, 
and the Mexican Army evacuated Texas.</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>"Texas declared her 
independence at Washington-on-the-Brazos March 2, 1836. For nearly</B> <B>two 
months her armies met disaster and defeat. Dr. James Grant's men were killed on 
the Agua Dulce March 2. William Barret Travis and his men sacrificed their lives 
at the Alamo March 6. William Ward was defeated at Refugio March 14. Amon B. 
King's men were executed near Refugio March 16, and James Walker Fannin and his 
army were put to death near Goliad March 27, 1836.</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>"On the battlefield at San 
Jacinto on April 21, 1836, the Army of Texas commanded by General Sam Houston, 
and accompanied by the Secretary of War, Thomas J. Rusk, attacked the larger 
invading army of Mexicans under General Santa Anna. The battle line from left to 
right was formed by Sidney Sherman's regiment, Edward Burleson's regiment, the 
artillery commanded by George W. Hockley, Henry Millard's infantry and the 
calvary under Mirabeau B. Lamar. Sam</B> <B>Houston led the infantry charge.</B> 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>"With the battle cry, "Remember 
the Alamo! Remember Goliad!" The Texans charged. The enemy taken by surprise 
rallied for a few minutes, then fled in disorder. The Texans had asked no 
quarter and gave none. The slaughter was appalling. Victory complete and Texas 
free! On the following day General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, self-styled 
"Napoleon of the West," received from a generous foe the mercy he had denied 
Travis at the Alamo and Fannin at Goliad.</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>"Measured by its results, San 
Jacinto was one of the decisive battles of the world. The Freedom of Texas from 
Mexico won at San Jacinto led to annexation and to the Mexican War, resulting in 
the acquisition by the United States of the states of Texas, New Mexico, 
Arizona, Nebraska, California, Utah and parts of Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas and 
Oklahoma. Almost one-third of the present area of the American nation, nearly a 
million square miles of territory changed sovereignty.</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>"Citizens of Texas and 
immigrant soldiers in the Army of Texas at San Jacinto were natives of Alabama, 
Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, North 
Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, 
Vermont, Virginia, Austria, Canada, England, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, 
Mexico, Poland, Portugal and Scotland."</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>Many Masons assumed leadership 
roles and were active in the birth of The Republic of Texas, such as: Stephen F. 
Austin, Sam Houston, William B. Travis, James Bowie, David Crockett, James 
Bonham, Ben Milam, David G. Burnet, James Fannin, Mirabeau B. Lamar, Anson 
Jones, Lorenzo de Zavala, Edward Burleson, Thomas Rusk, Juan Seguin and many 
more.</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>As Masons, we must continue to 
lead our Great State, and our nation. and let us never forget those who have 
gone before us!</B> <BR>&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>TWO&nbsp; DAYS&nbsp; 
BEFORE&nbsp; THE&nbsp; BATTLE</B> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>This morning we are in 
preparation to meet Santa Anna. It is the only chance of saving Texas.&nbsp; 
From time to time I have looked for reinforcements in vain:&nbsp; We will only 
have about 700 men to march with besides the camp guard. We go to conquer. It is 
wisdom growing out of necessity to meet the enemy. Now every consideration 
enforces it. The troops are in fine spirits and now is the time for action. We 
shall use our best efforts to fight the enemy to such advantage as will 
insure</B> <B>victory though the odds, are greatly against us.</B> </FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff><B>I leave the result 
in the hands of a wise God,&nbsp; and rely upon his providence. My country will 
do justice to those who serve her. The rights for which we fight will be secure 
and Texas Free!</B> <B><I>- General Sam Houston</I></B></FONT></P>
