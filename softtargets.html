<p align=center><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">The program is being given by a Training Officer from the US Dept. of Homeland Security, as part of their outreach to "Soft Targets, Crowded Places" - places where crowds of people gather that normally do not have security in place.  (Think: Churches, Clubs, Masonic Lodges...) With current terrorist activity targeting soft targets abroad, now is the time for us to know what to look for, and how to exercise "situational awareness" and diligence.</font></p> 

<p align=center><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">The program is being hosted by Duck Creek Lodge #1419, and the John B. Jones Masonic Ranger Company, part of the Former Texas Rangers Foundation and authorized under Art. 25 of the Grand Lodge of Texas constitution.</font></p> 

<p align=center><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">The program is being provided by Region VI, North Texas Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Infrastructure Security Division of the US DHS.  Our instructor will speak about resources available from the DHS, and present both the "Active Shooter" and "Suspicious Persons" lectures.  He will be available after the program for a question and answer session.</font></p>

<p align=center><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">We will have dinner at 6:00 pm, which will consist of cold-cuts, sandwiches and snacks.  The program will start at 7:00 pm and will last for approx 2 hours, including question and answer opportunities.</font></p>

<p align=center><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Trebuchet MS">This will NOT be a Tiled Lodge, so is open to all interested brethren, family and friends.   We will also be extending invitations to interested local Law Enforcement and City Officials.</font></p>
