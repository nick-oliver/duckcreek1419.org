  Mike Moses is Awarded the Mirabeau B. Lamar Award at Duck Creek Lodge</strong></font></P>
<P align=left><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brethren,</font></P>
<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last 
  night we presented the Mirabeau B. Lamar Award to Dr. Mike Moses. We had a decent 
  turn out between our Lodge Family and Dr. Moses' friends, which included the 
  famous Homer B. Johnson.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our 
  Stewards, John Puckett and David Carter, produced a spread of absolutely wonderful 
  food including pork chops (2 inches thick) and a selection of desserts to die 
  for. I would like to personally praise the successful efforts of Brother Puckett 
  and Brother Carter. We might have served everyone on paper plates and with plastic 
  silverware, but what they put on those plates was excellent. Thank you very 
  much John and David, I am very proud of the work y'all are doing for the Lodge.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. 
  Moses was born on October 12, 1951 to Dr. &amp; Mrs. Morgan Moses of Longview, 
  Texas (at that time). Mike's dad, Morgan, came to the Masonic Home and School 
  in Fort Worth, Texas around 1928 and was there until 1940 or 1941. After separating 
  from the Home and School, Morgan Moses joined the Army Air Corp and served his 
  country proudly during World War II. Returning home after the war, Morgan married 
  Marie Frances and began teaching in 1948. Somewhere in there Morgan was made 
  a Master Mason. In the mid 50's Morgan moved his family to Garland to be the 
  principal at Garland High School. Many of you will remember Morgan. He left 
  GHS for Stephen F. Austin University in 1964 to become Dean of the Education 
  Program. Nacogdoches and SFA were good to the Moses family. Dr. Mike Moses graduated 
  high school and attended college classes there as well. Later on Mike would 
  receive his Doctorate in Education Administration from East Texas State University. 
  Dr. Mike Moses would receive more than just an education as a young man being 
  raised by Dr. Morgan Moses. Morgan and Marie clearly instilled strong morals, 
  never ending ethics, everlasting compassion, a sense of humor, and most of all, 
  they gave Monte and Mike a lot of love. It is also apparent Morgan shared his 
  passion for Education with Mike and Monte.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. 
  Mike Moses began teaching history for Duncanville ISD in 1974, but transferred 
  to Garland ISD as an Assistant Principal in 1976 and was quickly made Principal 
  in 1977 where he remained until 1982. During that time I was a student at Brandenburg 
  Middle School in Garland, where Dr. Moses was Principal, and he just happen 
  to live across the alley from me and my family. While attending Brandenburg 
  I would notice Dr. Moses and witness his character, though it would be more 
  than 20 years before I would fully understand what it was he had actually done 
  for me. That in mind, I have no doubt he was the same to everyone. From there 
  he became the Superintendent of Tatum ISD, La Marque ISD, and Lubbock ISD. Dr. 
  Moses was appointed Commissioner of the Texas Education Agency. In 1999 he returned 
  to Lubbock as Deputy Chancellor of Texas Tech University before coming home 
  to Dallas in 2001 to be Superintendent of Dallas ISD where he remained until 
  2004. Dr. Moses is currently sitting on several boards of directors and consults 
  for numerous school districts around the state and country.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While 
  Dr. Moses' resume alone would most likely qualify him to received the Lamar 
  Award, it is his character and passion that actually qualifies him (in my opinion). 
  Dr. Mike Moses was made a Master Mason in October of 1981 at Garland Lodge #441. 
  Dr. Moses has clearly put his Masonic teachings to use in his life and continues 
  to use them to this day. It is one thing to put great effort into the education 
  of others, but it is a much higher level compassion and caring to actual continue 
  to worry decades later whether or not he had a positive effect on those students 
  lives. Dr. Moses has always been more concerned with making sure his students 
  got a solid, competitive, and complete education. His service to this Community 
  and this State and as a result, the Country at large, is immeasurable.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Morgan 
  taught Mike what it was to be a Man and showed Mike what it is to be a Mason. 
  Brother Williams of Garland #441 taught Mike what is to be a Mason and Mike 
  learned what it is to be an Educator. Dr. Mike Moses has showed us all what 
  it is to be an Authentic Human, a Man, a Mason, and what Education should be 
  about, the children. We could say for those reasons we gave Dr. Moses the Lamar 
  Award, but I would say to you all that it is for those reasons Dr. Mike Moses 
  EARNED the Mirabeau B. Lamar Award. </font></p>
